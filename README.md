"LEARNING HOW TO LEARN" on coursera- Notes 
       - BY Naman Nimmo Gera (namangera15@gmail.com)

What is learning?

2 Types of thinking/learning:

1) Focused mode -  thinking which involves concentrated thoughts about a specific topic. Examples would be multiplying numbers. This is used to work out the finer details of an idea. It involves the prefrontal cortex in the brain.

2) Diffuse mode -  thinking is the use of relaxed, unfocused and unrelated thought patterns enabling connections between very different ideas within the brain. Often done when doing exercise, daydreaming or when you zone out.

- When we learn something new, many new synapses are formed on the dendrites.


2 Types of memory:

1) Working memory (Short term) -  consists of 4 'slots' which can hold information. Like an inefficient blackboard.

2) Long term memory -  is like a storage warehouse, and can store almost unlimited amounts of information but practise is required to efficiently retrieve memories.


Improving your learning

> Chunking is the process we use to create memorable chunks of information which the brain can easily access in one package. It can be described as mental leap to unite information through understanding. They do not require conscious thought to make use of the information they connect. Imagine a hyperlink to a page, you only need to click on the hyperlink to access the collection of information. You don't need to access all of the information separately on different pages.

> An example of a chunk would be when going to drive and you pull out of your drive. You don't follow each individual step mentally, you just think, let's get onto the road and off you go. This is because the information has been formed into a chunk which your mind can access in one go.

> Stress reduces the efficiency of chunking information.

> To be creative you need to have solid conceptual chunks which you can combine.

> Forming a chunk requires the use of the focused mode of thinking.


Steps to form a chunk - (The Most important!!)
> First you have to create mini chunks of information which you learn through practise and repetition and focused attention.
   
> This requires undivided attention because all of the slots of your working memory are used to hold the mini chunks.
	 
>Through the use of the focused mode coupled with bouts of diffuse mode thinking, you knit these mini chunks together into larger chunks which then form the chunk. Gradually less of your working memory is used by the information, until it is condensed down to 1 slot.


Summary of Week 1:
> In General, people have two different modes of thinking i.e. focussed thinking, and diffused thinking.
> The focussed mode is centered at the pre-frontal cortex on the forehead.
> The easiest way to tackle procrastination is to use the so called "Pomodoro technique" which I genuinely use everytime I do any task.
> Long term memory is like a storage ware house.
> sleep is an important part of learning, because it helps in washing away the useless toxins that develop during our daily activities.


Techniques to help learning:

   Memory techniques help to create chunks and help you to learn concepts quicker. They deepen understanding and turn memorising into an exercise in creativity (especially metaphors and the memory palace). This helps you to develop your creativity!

Recall:

   > Recalling the information means self-testing, checking and making sure the information in your memory is correct.

   > Do not reread! Recall! Recalling information has proven to be the most effective method of learning information.

   > The recall process is known to enhance deep learning and form solid chunks.

   > Helps to avoid illusions of competence due to the self-assessment of the knowledge you know.

   > In 1 hour of testing you often learn more than 1 hour of learning.

Deliberate Practise:

   This is where you focus on learning the more difficult information which aids the understanding of more basic information.

Picture walkthrough:

   This is where you go through the headings of a document, or the chapter titles in a book to get a general sense of the information before focusing and going into detail. This makes effective use of the focused and diffuse modes of the brain.
 
 Interleaving:

    > This is where you jump back and forth between different techniques or problems so as to build creativity and flexibility.

    > As well as knowing how to use a technique or chunk, you also need to know when to use it and interleaving builds up the knowledge of when to use the information.


 Spaced Repetition:

    > This is where you review information over an increasing period of time.

    > A little work each time reinforces the information.

    > Your understanding could be thought of like a brick wall - you build it up brick by brick, but the mortar needs time to dry.

    > Can be used in conjunction with many other techniques.

    > Practise enables average brains to work at the level of brains with more natural gifts. Just like gaining muscle you can deepen and enlarge the mental patterns in your mind.

    > A good example is the use of flash cards. Using systems like Anki to space to repetition out.

    > Try this before bed to help maximise learning

    > Try to practise flash cards out loud so as to use make links with the sounds. The more links the better!


  Metaphors & Analogies:

     > Very powerful for learning new concepts.

     > You can make a boring/unmemorable concept very memorable.

     > You can do this with a very key distinctive image.

     > This helps to build neural hooks.

     > Try it using imagining different senses.

     > Enables prior understanding of concepts to be applied to new information, improving memory efficiency and speed

     > Very useful for getting out of Einstellung.

   Memory palaces:

      > This is where you use a location you are familiar with to help you to remember a list of unrelated items.

      > Imagine images or objects which represent the items placed within the location.

      > This technique becomes quicker to use with practise.

      > You can do mental walks to review and practice the information.

   
	 Other techniques:

    > Using acronyms can help to remember a list of words along with the use of a metaphorical image.

    > To remember numbers try to associate the numbers with a year or memory.

    > For lists of words you can also try to use memorable sentences - check online to see if someone has already come up with one.

    > Teaching others can be an effective way to aid your own understanding.
		
		
Procrastination-- (what is it?) well, all of us know :D but here are some tips to avoid it :)

   > When starting a task which we do not enjoy, the feeling of unease has a similar brain pattern to pain and so we swap to something more pleasant. This is called Procrastination.

   > Procrastination is especially important because to build solid neural chunks you need time and you cannot put it off until last minute.
   
   > Using willpower is one method people use to combat procrastination but willpower uses a lot of neural resources. You should avoid using it to fend off procrastination.


Summary of week 2:

    week 2 was exploring "chunks" in the process of learning. anyway, I have already said enough about chunking above.
		

Summary of Week 3:(procrastination and memory)
   
	   First time learning something:

        > The first time you do something the deluge of information coming at you would make the job seem almost impossibly difficult. But, once you've chunked it, it will be simple.

        > At first, it's really hard, later it's easy. It becomes like a habit. Ex: Driving for the first time.
     
		 Habits:

        > Neuro-scientifically speaking, chunking is related to habit.

        > Habit is an energy saver. You don’t need to focus when performing different habitual tasks.

        > Habits can be good or bad, brief or long.
				
			
			Focus on Process: (The most interesting part)

         > You should realize that it’s perfectly normal to start a learning session with a negative feeling even if you like the subject. It’s how you handle those feelings that matters.

         >  Solution: Focus on the process, not the product(If you do not like the process of doing something, then fuck it). The product is what triggers the pain that causes you to procrastinate. Instead of saying "I will solve this task today", put your best effort for a period of time continuously over the days.

      
			Memory Techniques:

         > Create meaningful groups and abbreviations.

         > To remember numbers, associate them to memorable events.

         > Create mnemonic phrases from first letters of the words you want to remember.

         > Memory Palace Technique: Use a familiar place (like the blueprint of your house) and associate visual images of things you want to remember with physical places.

         > This is not easy. You’ll be very slow at first. But with practice, you’ll get better.

         > The more you practice your "memory muscle" the easier you’ll remember.


Week 4: Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential:
       
	 You should know:

    > Exercising is by far more effective than any drug to help you learn better. It helps new neurons survive.

    > Learning doesn't always progress linearly and logically. Inevitably your brain will hit a knowledge-collapse sometimes. This usually means your brain is restructuring its understanding, building a more solid foundation.

    > You learn complex concepts by trying to make sense out of the information you perceive. Not by having someone else telling it to you.
		
    
		Metaphors:

    > Metaphors and analogies are very helpful, not only to memorize, but to also understand different concepts.

    > It is often helpful to pretend that you are the concept you’re trying to understand.

 		
		Intelligence:

    > Intelligence does matter. Being smart usually equate to having a large working memory (more than just four slots).

    > However, a super working memory can hold its thoughts so tightly that new thoughts won’t easily find a way into the brain. Such a tightly controlled attention could use an occasional breath of ADHD. You attention shifts even if you don’t want it to shift.

    > Deliberate practice is what helps the average brain lift into the realm of those naturally gifted. Practicing certain mental patterns deepens your mind.

    > Brilliant scientist like Ramón y Cajal, the father of neuroscience, or Charles Darwin, were not exceptionally gifted. The key to their success was perseverance, taking responsibility for their learning and changing their thoughts.

    > Take pride in the qualities you excel at. Tune people out if they try to demean your efforts.

    
		Best practices:

    > Always step back and recheck to takes advantages of abilities of both-hemispheres interactions.

    > Brainstorm and find focused people to analyze your work with.

    > Your errors are sometimes easier to be found by others.

    > Explaining yourself to others helps you understand more.

    > Studying in a team helps you catch what you missed, or what you can’t see.
  
    > Don’t fool yourself. Don’t blindly believe in your intellectual abilities. Having a team can bring those projections down.
